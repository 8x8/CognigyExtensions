- [API Documentation](https://vantage-preview.abbyy.com/api/index.html?urls.primaryName=publicapi%2Fv1)


## Connections

In order to use the whole Extension, two different Connections need to be defined.

**OAuth:**

Takes the OAuth information and is required for executing the **Authenticate** Flow Node.

- clientId
  - The Abbyy instance client ID
- clientSecret
  - The Abbyy instance client Secret
- username
- password
- url
  - The Abby authentication url
  - e.g. https://vantage-preview.abbyy.com/auth/connect/token

**Instance:**

After successfully authenticating the system user, the actual **Abbyy Vantage** instance needs to be defined as it will be used by all other Flow Nodes in this Extension.

- instanceUri
  - e.g. vantage-preview.abbyy.com
  - *Please make sure to remove the last "/" from the url*

### Node: Authenticate

Uses the OAuth Connection and creates the required Access Token that is stored in Cognigy:

```json
{
    "abbyy": {
        "auth": {
        "access_token": "eyJh...",
        "expires_in": 2592000,
        "token_type": "Bearer",
        "scope": "openid permissions"
        }
    }
}
```

**Please store the result into the [Cognigy Context](https://docs.cognigy.com/docs/context) in order to make it accessible during the whole conversation.**

### Node: Get Skills

```json
{
    "abbyy": {
        "skills": [
            {
                "id": "3456tdfh-23453-345-bee5-3563grfedge",
                "name": "MySkillOne",
